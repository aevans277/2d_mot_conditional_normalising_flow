# 2D MOT Conditional Normalising Flow (CNF) Model

Begin by creating an environment with the dependencies listed in environment.yml:

*conda env create -f environment.yml*

Then activate the environment:

*conda activate cnf*

Ensure that the required data is in ./data/compiled before beginning.

Then run CNF.py to begin training the algorithm, and feel free to experiment with the values of the hyperparameters, e.g. k, batch size etc.

There is an additional debug tool to experiment with the final plot in the plots folder.
